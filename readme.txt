## Usage
To run the program, you need to execute the main.py file using the following command:

python main.py

# The program will ask you to enter the URL(s) of the website(s) that you want to scrape data from. You can enter one or more URLs separated by commas. For example:

Enter the URL(s) of the website(s) to scrape data from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence, https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nt3edWLgIg

# The program will then scrape the data from the website(s), process and analyze the data, create a knowledge graph from the data, learn from the knowledge graph, and evaluate the program for its progress and performance towards achieving AGI.

# The program will display the results and outputs of each step on the console. For example:

Scraping data from the website(s)...
Data scraped successfully.

Processing the scraped data...
Data processed successfully.

Analyzing the processed data...
Data analyzed successfully.

Creating a knowledge graph from the data...
Knowledge graph created successfully.

Learning from the knowledge graph...
Knowledge graph learned successfully.

Evaluating the program for its progress and performance towards achieving AGI...
Program evaluated successfully.

The score of the program is 0.85.
The program is able to learn from any data source, reason across multiple domains, generalize to new tasks and situations, communicate in natural language, and align with human values and goals.

# The program will also save the results and outputs of each step as files in the output folder. For example:

data.csv: The scraped data as a dataframe.
data_processed.csv: The processed data as a dataframe.
data_analyzed.csv: The analyzed data as a dataframe.
kg_network.gexf: The knowledge graph as a network object.
kg_graph.rdf: The knowledge graph as a graph object.
kg_database.db: The knowledge graph as a database object.
model_s.h5: The supervised learning model as a tensor object.
model_u.pkl: The unsupervised learning model as a list object.
agent_r.h5: The reinforcement learning agent as a tensor object.
y_pred_s.csv: The supervised learning output as a dataframe.
y_pred_u.csv: The unsupervised learning output as a dataframe.
y_pred_r.csv: The reinforcement learning output as a dataframe.
text.csv: The text from the knowledge graph as a dataframe.
images.csv: The images from the knowledge graph as a dataframe.
text_understood.csv: The understood text as a dataframe.
text_generated.csv: The generated text as a dataframe.
