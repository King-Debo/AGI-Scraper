# AGI-Scraper

AGI-Scraper is a Python program that scrapes data from the web, processes and analyzes the data, represents the data as a knowledge graph, learns from the knowledge graph, and evaluates the progress and performance of the program towards achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).

## Features

- Web scraping: The program can scrape data from multiple websites, such as Wikipedia, Reddit, or YouTube, and return the scraped data as a list or a dataframe.
- Data processing: The program can clean, filter, parse, tokenize, and encode the scraped data, and return the processed data as a list or a dataframe.
- Data analysis: The program can extract features, patterns, trends, and insights from the processed data, and return the analyzed data as a list or a dataframe.
- Knowledge representation: The program can create, update, and query a knowledge graph from the analyzed data, and return the knowledge graph as a network or a graph object.
- Machine learning: The program can apply supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning algorithms to the knowledge graph, and return the learned parameters, weights, or policies as a list or a tensor.
- Natural language processing: The program can understand, generate, or translate text from the knowledge graph, and return the processed text as a string or a list.
- Computer vision: The program can recognize, detect, or segment visual information from the knowledge graph, and return the processed images as an array or a list.
- AGI evaluation: The program can apply the Turing test, the Winograd schema test, or the AGI criteria to the program, and return the scores, results, or feedback as a number or a string.
